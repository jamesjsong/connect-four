Connect four

connect_four.py : Project made for CS50, Introduction to Computer Science at Harvard College. Using minimax algorithm, I made an AI that plays against the user. It looks five moves ahead into the game and chooses the move that most favors its win, avoiding ones that will result in its loss. As of Feb. 26, 2020, of the dozens who have played it, only two people have beat the program. 

You can play it on the command-line!

Credits to people for providing the framework of the program is in the file.
